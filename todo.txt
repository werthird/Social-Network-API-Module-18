  reaction should basically be treated like a comment. It has a specific user who created the reaction, and it has a thought that the reaction is created for.



=============================================================

I have a validator on the user schema email.
- When i update a users email, the email is not validated. It can be sent in the wrong format. Would need to add some client side logic to validate that the email is in the proper format.
